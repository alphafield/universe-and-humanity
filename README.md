# Universe and Humanity

A structural view of the universe, civilization, and humanity.

This repository is not a theory, not a belief system,  
and not a philosophical doctrine.

It presents structure.

---

Humanity is not outside the universe.  
Humanity is one of its persistent forms.

Structure is invariant across languages.
